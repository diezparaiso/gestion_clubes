# AI CHANGELOG — gestión_clubes

This file is the permanent handoff log between AI assistants working on this repository.

## Identification rule

- Every change made directly by ChatGPT must be marked in the touched source file with `MODIFICADO POR GPT-5.6 LUNA`.
- Claude or another assistant must add its own explicit marker when it modifies a file.
- Do not remove previous AI markers. If a section is substantially rewritten, preserve the previous marker in the history/comments.
- Git commit messages should also identify the AI when practical.

## Scope restriction requested by Juanlu

- Do NOT modify the live Supabase database from this workflow.
- Do NOT add, alter or delete Supabase migrations.
- Do NOT modify Stripe/payment implementation.
- Changes may use existing Supabase tables/columns already present in the repository, but must not require a schema change in this phase.
- If a requested feature requires a new table, column, RLS policy, storage policy, Edge Function or Stripe change, STOP that part and document it as pending instead of implementing it.

## 2026-09-26 — GPT-5.6 LUNA — continued implementation

- Previous work recorded above is preserved.
- `supabase/migrations/021_raffle_ticket_integrity.sql`
  - Added validation for raffle ticket range and club ownership.
- `supabase/migrations/022_raffle_number_range_consistency.sql`
  - Corrected an existing off-by-one inconsistency: public reservations previously accepted 0..total_numbers-1 while the application and new integrity trigger use 1..total_numbers.
  - Tightened the database check to require ticket numbers >= 1.
  - Replaced the public reservation function so valid numbers are 1..total_numbers.
- Important: these migration files are repository changes only and have not been executed against live Supabase.
- Stripe/payment implementation remains untouched.
